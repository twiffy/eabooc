  Online Courses (MOOCs) and other Open Online Courses</h1>

  <h2 class="c3">Introduction</h2>

  <p class="c4">Indiana University (“IU”) hosts this course
  (hereafter “OOC”) using Google’s Course Builder platform. You
  will need a Google Account in order to participate in any IU OOC
  hosted on Course Builder. Your use of that account is subject to
  the Google Terms of Service, available at <a href=
  "http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/</a>.</p>

  <p class="c4">Your participation in any IU OOC, and your use of
  the IU site on which it is made available (the “Site”), are also
  subject to the following IU Terms of Use for the Site ("Terms of
  Use"). In consideration for your agreement to these Terms of Use,
  IU grants you a personal, non-exclusive, limited,
  non-transferable license to access and use the Site as described
  in this document.</p>

  <h2 class="c3">Acceptance of the Terms of Use</h2>

  <p class="c4">By using the Site and participating in an IU OOC,

  other on-line forum, course, or service made available by IU
  related to its OOCs. By using the Site and participating in an IU
  OOC, you signify and acknowledge that you have read these Terms
  of Use and agree that they constitute a binding and enforceable
  legal agreement between you (sometimes referred to as “End User”)
  and IU, and that you agree to be bound by and comply with the
  Terms of Use. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms of
  Use you may not access the Site or participate in an IU OOC. IU

  Terms of Use or any of its other policies, terms of use or terms
  of service (collectively, "IU Terms") for its OOCs or otherwise,

  you. You should check back frequently to determine whether any of
  the IU Terms have changed. If you do not agree to abide and be
  bound by the modified IU Terms, you should discontinue your
  participation in the OOC or other applicable IU program or
  service offering, because your continued participation in the OOC
  or IU program or service offering constitutes binding and ongoing

  THE IU PARTIES MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION REGARDING YOUR ABILITY TO
  TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM OR THROUGH THE SITE, AND
  YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE ONLINE COURSES AND SITE MAY BE
  IMPAIRED. THE IU PARTIES DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RESULTING
  FROM OR RELATED TO SUCH EVENTS OR THE ACCESS OR USE OF THE ONLINE
  COURSES OR SITE OR ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICES RELATED TO
  THEM.</p>

  OR SUCH INFORMATION OR SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

  <p class="c4">EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE IU PARTIES WILL
  NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR
  RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR (OR ANY THIRD PARTY'S) USE
  OR INABILITY TO USE AN ONLINE COURSE, SITE, DATA LOSS, YOUR
  PLACEMENT OF CONTENT ON A SITE, YOUR RELIANCE UPON INFORMATION
  OBTAINED FROM OR THROUGH AN ONLINE COURSE OR SITE, OR ANY OTHER
  POTENTIAL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ONLINE COURSES OR SITE.</p>

  <p class="c4">EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE IU PARTIES WILL
  NOT HAVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE,
  SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR
  UNFORESEEABLE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS FOR
  DEFAMATION, ERRORS, LOSS OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION IN AVAILABILITY
  OF DATA), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY ONLINE COURSE OR SITE, DATA LOSS, ANY
  PURCHASES ON THIS SITE, YOUR PLACEMENT OF CONTENT ON A SITE, OR

  THE PAST 12 MONTHS, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

  <p class="c4">THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF
  LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS TERMS OF USE REFLECT A REASONABLE AND
  FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND THE IU PARTIES, AND THESE
  LIMITATIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL BASIS FOR IU'S ABILITY TO MAKE THE
  SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BASIS.</p>

  <p class="c4">ANY CAUSE OF ACTION RELATED TO THE SITE MUST
  COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.

  appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
  copyright law.</p>

  <p class="c4">If you believe in good faith that materials on the
  Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a
  notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it
  blocked.</p>

  requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <span class=

  information for DMCA notices.</p>

  <p class="c4">You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
  IU Parties , from any and all liabilities, expenses and damages,

  arising out of any claim, suit or demand made by any third party

  violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any
  third party, or (c) information that you post or otherwise make
  available on the Site or through the OOC, including without
  limitation any claim of infringement or misappropriation of
  intellectual property or other proprietary rights.</p>

  <h2 class="c3">Termination Rights</h2>

  <p class="c4">IU, in its sole discretion, may terminate your use
  of the Site or your participation in it thereof, for any reason
  or no reason, and none of the IU Parties shall have any liability
  to you for any such action. For the purpose of any course
  delivered on the Site, your sole relationship with IU is as
  defined in these Terms of Use; for the avoidance of doubt, you do
  not have student status at IU solely by virtue of your
  participation in the OOC, and you are not entitled to any
  grievance or other resolution process for student disputes at IU.
  IU has the right to cancel, delay, reschedule or alter the format
  of any Online Course at any time, and none of the IU Parties
  shall have any liability to you for any such action. If you no
  longer desire to participate in the Site, you may terminate your
  participation therein upon notice to IU.</p>

  <p class="c4">If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t
  take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up
  any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the
  future). If it turns out that a particular term is not
  enforceable, it will not affect any other terms.</p>

  <p class="c4">The laws of the State of Indiana, U.S.A., excluding
  Indiana’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes
  arising out of or relating to these terms or your use of the
  Site. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the
  Site will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts
  in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A., and you and IU both consent to
  personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
