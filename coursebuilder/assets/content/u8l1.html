If you live in another state or if there is another test that is relevant to your context/goal and it has some sort of interpretation guide, then use that test for this assignment. Those of you in non-school settings have a choice of getting creative and finding something like a personality test or another sort of aptitude test, or just using one of the K-12 tests.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span>You may have to modify the assignment a bit to suit you. Look over the interpretation guide and the assignment and if it still does not make sense contact the instructor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>If you do not work with any standardized tests then just complete the assignment with one of the ones provided. This assignment is really about making sense of a handful of crucial concepts that anybody who has some expertise in assessment should be familiar with, primarily in the context you work in. Feel free to customize this assignment if need be to cover whatever stuff is relevant to interpreting standardized tests in your </span><span>context</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c1">Institutional Role and Lesson</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Describe your current and/or future role in the educational ecosystem relative to standardized tests.
