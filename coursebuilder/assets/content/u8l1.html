If you live in another state or if there is another test that is relevant to your role/context and it has some sort of interpretation guide, then use that test for this assignment. Those of you in non-school settings have a choice of getting creative and finding something like a personality test or another sort of aptitude test, or just using one of the K-12 tests.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>You may have to modify the assignment a bit to suit you. Look over the interpretation guide and the assignment and if it still does not make sense contact the instructor. </span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>If you do not work with any standardized tests then just complete the assignment with one of the ones provided. This assignment is really about making sense of a handful of crucial concepts that anybody who has some expertise in assessment should be familiar with, primarily in the context you work in.
