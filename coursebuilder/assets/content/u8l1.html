be the ISTEP or the ECA for which this assignment is specifically
tailored.  If there is another test that is relevant and it has some sort

have to modify the assignment a bit to suit you. Look over the interpretation
guide and the assignment and if it still does not make sense contact the
instructor. </span></font></p>

any standardized tests then just complete the assignment with the Indiana ISTEP

crucial concepts that anybody who has some expertise in assessment should be
familiar with, primarily in the context you work in. Feel free to
customize this assignment if need be to cover whatever stuff is relevant to
interpreting standardized tests in your context.</span></font></p>

them as answers to test questions for the instructor to read.  You do not
need fancy formatting, but put enough headers and links so that your classmates
and instructors can read and compare.  You should look and compare but to
reiterate you may not directly copy.  Keep in mind that each of these key
concepts is likely to appear on the final exam, and possibly in more than one
format. </font></span></p>
