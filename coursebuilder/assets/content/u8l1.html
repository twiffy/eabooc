standardized tests. &nbsp;You will learn about whatever standardized test is most relevant to you and about the controversial new test coming to US schools.</span></p><p class="c4 c11"><span class="c14 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">A note about standardized tests:</span><span>&nbsp;This assignment will present the K-12 standardized tests for Indiana, Illinois, and Georgia as well as a couple of standardized tests from ETS. If you live in another state or if there is another test that is relevant to your role/context and it has some sort of interpretation guide, then use that test for this assignment. Those of you in non-school settings have a choice of getting creative and finding something like a personality test or another sort of aptitude test, or just using one of the K-12 tests.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span>You may have to modify the assignment a bit to suit you. Look over the interpretation guide and the assignment and if it still does not make sense contact the instructor. </span></p><p class="c4 c11"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>If you do not work with any standardized tests then just complete the assignment with one of the ones provided. This assignment is really about making sense of a handful of crucial concepts that anybody who has some expertise in assessment should be familiar with, primarily in the context you work in.
