  <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c4">Unit 9: Test
  Preparation</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>In this assignment, you will learn about
  appropriate and inappropriate test preparation practices by
  drafting scenarios and discussing them with your classmates to
  see whether or not they are appropriate.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>To help appreciate how these guidelines apply
  to different testing formats, you are asked to create scenarios
  for different high-stakes assessments your students will face.
  This is the point in the course where everybody should be
  confidently projecting their professional identity and
  recognizing and anticipating those of their classmates.
  &nbsp;What you teach, where you teach, and how students are
  assessed makes a very big difference in what is appropriate.
  Likewise, there is often a wide divergence between what
  administrators and teachers think is appropriate. There should be
  some serious discussion here about these issues.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>This assignment is associated with Popham
  Chapter 14 (7th edition). &nbsp;There are chapters in this topic
  in the earlier versions and there is quite a bit of information
  on this topic available on the web.</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c6"></p>

  <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c4">Reiterate Your Context (By
  November 10)</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c6"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Provide a short summary of your lesson and
  context from the first assignment for the benefit of the other
  participants (so they don’t have to look back). &nbsp;You should
  also add any new insights about the lesson that have emerged as
  you have thought about it more in the previous
  assignment(s).</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>In particular, think about your lesson and
  context relative to test preparation. What is appropriate and
  inappropriate may depend on your role and some subjects and tests
  are more readily compromised. &nbsp;Those of you in non-school
  settings have a choice of getting creative and finding something
  like a workplace test, or just using one of the K-12
  tests.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c4">Consider The Concepts (All
  Required By November 10)</span></p>

  <p class="c2 c6"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">General Test Preparation
  Guidelines.</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>There are two guidelines that can be used to
  judge whether an assessment is “appropriate” or “inappropriate,”
  says Popham. These two guidelines are:</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <ul class="c7 lst-kix_9o0cbfos8xg1-0 start">
    <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Professional Ethics
    --</span><span>&nbsp;“No test-preparation should violate the
    ethical norms of the education profession” (Popham, p.
    358).</span></li>

    <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Educational Defensibility
    --</span> <span>“No test-preparation practice should increase
    students’ test scores without simultaneously increasing
    students’ mastery of the curricular aim tested” (Popham, p.
    359).</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>In a number of paragraphs, explain and
  discuss t</span><span>he two evaluative guidelines in your own
  words. Try to elaborate on the consequences of these guidelines
  for practice, consider the challenges educators might encounter
  in following these guidelines, and summarize the role that test
  form and test item format play in distinguishing between
  appropriate and inappropriate test preparation.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Explicitly ponder how these guidelines take
  on different meanings for (a) different assessment formats, (b)
  different domains, and (c) different roles.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">Selected-Response
  Scenario</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Write a testing scenario, based on your own
  teaching and testing context, where the appropriateness of the
  situation is called into question. The scenario should push your
  classmates to apply the two guidelines relative to preparing your
  students for the highest-stakes selected-response test you
  discuss. Your scenario should include a reference to item format
  (i.e., require a judgment as to whether the format
  is</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c3">same</span><span class=
  "c3 c8">&nbsp;</span><span>or</span><span class=
  "c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">varied</span><span>). Try to
  draft a tricky scenario that prompts discussion and debate and
  reveals how different stakeholders have different interpretations
  of what is “ethical” and “educational.” &nbsp;You want to
  specifically address how testing practices might be called into
  question when students are asked to recall information
  (selected-response). The point here is to consider the
  appropriateness of test-preparation practices for
  selected-response formats.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">Constructed-Response
  Scenario</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Write another scenario that calls the test
  preparation practices into question. Again, try to draft a tricky
  scenario that helps reveal the range of interpretations of
  “ethical” and “educational” and how this is complicated by
  broader item formats.</span> <span>The point here is to consider
  how test preparation is impacted when a high-stakes examination
  is based on recalling information (selected-response) vs.
  constructing a solution (constructed-response).</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">Apply Educationally Defensible
  Test Preparation Practices</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Popham describes five Test-Preparation
  Practices that are very commonly used among teachers. He finds
  that only two of the five satisfy both Professional Ethics and
  Educational Defensibility (table 14.1, page 364):.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <ul class="c7 lst-kix_wxhh4v292ksp-0 start">
    <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Varied format
    preparation</span> <span>involves preparing students with
    classroom assessments that represent content in varied ways,
    which can include the way it is represented on the
    test.</span></li>

    <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Generalized test taking
    preparation</span> <span>involves special instructions for
    particular types of test formats.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Rearrange the boxes to indicate which form of
  preparation is most appropriate for whatever high-stakes tests
  your students face. &nbsp;Even if you accept the order that they
  are, move them up and down so the assignment knows you did the
  activity. Then explain why the first is more relevant than the
  second. &nbsp;You can use any criteria that are important to you,
  but your answers should show understanding of the difference
  between increased scores and increased learning.
  &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">Consider Inappropriateness of
  Common Test Preparation Practices</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Popham describes three common test
  preparation practices that are not educationally
  defensible:</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <ul class="c7 lst-kix_k2qpkky2j1oi-0 start">
    <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Previous-form
    preparation</span> <span>provides special instruction and
    practice using previous forms of the actual test</span></li>

    <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Current-form preparation</span>
    <span>provides special instruction and practice using the test
    currently being used</span></li>

    <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Same format preparation</span>
    <span>uses practice items that are identical in format to the
    items on the targeted test, even though the content of the
    items may be different.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Rearrange to boxes to indicate which form of
  preparation is</span> <span class="c3">most
  inappropriate</span><span>&nbsp;in terms of inflating scores,
  undermining learning, etc. &nbsp;In other words the first form or
  preparation is the one that is most damaging to students, while
  the last one is least damaging. &nbsp;(rearrange the boxes even
  if you accept the order they start in). &nbsp;Then provide a
  justification for the ranking that makes it clear why the first
  one is most inappropriate and the last one is least
  inappropriate. &nbsp;Take into account the overall consequences
  of the practice and consider discussion how common these
  practices are and how hard it is to avoid them.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Decide which of the two</span>
  <span>Test-Preparation Practices are most appropriate and
  relevant in your context and role</span><span>.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>in order of relevance within your role and
  context</span> <span>(Popham, p. 361). Here you may think of
  relevance in many different ways. For instance, as an
  administrator, you might need to carefully lock up current-forms
  of the test because of its potential inappropriate use, so you
  would choose this as your most relevant. Or as a teacher you
  might choose varied-format because it is something you never
  thought of before.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">Big Ideas</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Review the chapter, assignment, and your
  peers’ wikifolios. Also, read the</span><span class=
  "c3">&nbsp;Chapter Summary</span> <span>and</span> <span class=
  "c3">What Teachers Need to Know. &nbsp;</span><span class=
  "c4">Come up with three big ideas.</span> <span>&nbsp;Number the
  ideas (1, 2, 3) and list them in order of importance to you,
  keeping in mind your role and context. Write a brief
  summary/explanation of each idea where you make it clear why they
  are relevant to you. These are the BIG ideas of the chapter not
  the more specific concepts listed above. You should refer to
  the</span> <span class="c3">What Teachers Need to Know….</span>
  <span>section and the summary at the end of the chapter.</span>
  <span class="c8">Try to insert your experience and academic
  domain into this discussion.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c4">OPTIONAL ELEMENTS (MOST BY
  NOVEMBER 10)</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">Performance/Portfolio
  Scenario</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>I</span><span>magine your students will face
  a high-stakes performance assessment or portfolio assessment.
  &nbsp;Pick whichever format is most most relevant to you (you
  might refer back to the performance or portfolio assessment
  &nbsp;you created in Assignment 4). &nbsp;Again, try to draft a
  tricky scenario that helps reveal the range of interpretations of
  “ethical” and “educational” and how this is complicated by
  broader item formats. The point here is to consider how test
  preparation is impacted when the test is based performing a task
  or compiling a portfolio.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c5"><span class="c4">Self-Check</span></p>

  <p class="c5"><span>Take the self-check at the end of the
  chapter.</span> <span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>Answer all of
  the questions without looking up the answers. If you can't answer
  the items you should go back over that section.</span>
  <span class="c4">Say a few words about the ones you got wrong and
  why.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"></p>
