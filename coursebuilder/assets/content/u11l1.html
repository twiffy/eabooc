Simply put, students who do relatively well on classroom assessments should do relatively well on external achievement tests.  This assignment will help you learn to do that.  You will walk through the steps of conducting assessment-based grading for your lesson or unit.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1.
