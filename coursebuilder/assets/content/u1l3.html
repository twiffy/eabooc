<p>During this first week you will:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>    Define a lesson or instructional unit to work with during class.</li>
    <li>    Identify an educational standard that this lesson is aligned to</li>
    <li>    Review Popham (2014) Chapter 1  and identify the most relevant and least relevant big ideas</li>
    <li>    Discuss your wikifolios with the instructor and your classmates via comments at the bottom.</li>
    <li>    Reflect on what you learned and how you learned it.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>  You must complete the assignment up to the discussion by Sunday night at 8 pm to get full points, and will loose one point a day for each day you are late posting a draft with all of the required elements.  You will then discuss and reflect on your wikifolio after the deadline to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>  <strong>Hints on selecting a lesson.</strong> You should pick a lesson that covers roughly a week of class periods, and something that is important to you.  Over the semester you will be developing, critiquing, and refining assessments for this lesson.  You can change activities later if this one is not working, or select a new one for specific activities if you like.  The main point is give you a context for applying the big ideas from each chapter.  You need to select a task that lends itself to a variety of assessment formats. You should not use a “performance” because the performance will speak for itself, it is not something that would normally be assessed with paper and pencil items. This is particularly the case for students in IST and music education. You may wish to come up with a one lesson for the early chapters on multiple choice and short answer, then switch to a performance for the performance assessment chapter. </p>
<p>  <strong>Hints on completing the assignment.</strong> You do not need to seek feedback before posting.  <em><strong>The instructor will give you feedback on your entry in your wikifolio. </strong></em>You might look a the entries by your instructor and classmates before attempting yours.  Aspects of this assignment will be new to you.  But we will do almost exactly the same thing each week.  This instructions are very detailed in this first lesson but get much more concise after that.</p>
<p>  <strong>1.  Create a new wikifolio page under your home page. </strong>Go to your wikifolio home page on the left.  Create a new page on your wikifolio by (a) clicking the black New Page icon on the upper right.  Then (b) name the page Lesson and Standard Selection, (c) use the default Web Page template, (d) select the location under your under your wikifolio homepage (your name), (e) click the red Create button on the upper left, and (f) click the blue Save. </p>
<p>  Now go back to your home page (click your home page on the &quot;breadcrumb&quot; links at the top or just got the the class homepage).  If you put the new page in the correct locations it will be listed as a subpage.  Edit your homepage (the pencil on the upper right) and drag and drop a copy of the subpage under Assessment Practices.  Then save the page.</p>
<p>  <strong>2.  Lesson Summary. </strong>Your page will open in edit format (notice the toolbar across the top).  Put in a bold header called Lesson Summary (ctrl-b or the toolbar icon B).  Then describe a lesson or activity that covers roughly five hours of class or online learning.  The activity can be something you developed, or something that someone else developed or a combination.  Ideally it will be something that your classmates will find interesting and worthy of comment, and something that lends itself to a variety of assessments.  You will be able to revise and adjust as you go or even change completely so don't worry too such.  The point is that you need a context to apply the big ideas about the different assessment formats to.  Click save and see what your page will look like to others.<br />
Note that two class members can do the same activity (presumably from an existing curriculum). But each student must complete the assessment development and refinement work independently. Students should collaborated and interact but students should not “divide” the work between themselves.</p>
<p>  <strong>3.  Lesson Context.</strong> Go back to edit more (click on the pencil upper right).  Add a header called Lesson Context and add more detailed description of your instructional activity, and explain why this activity is the one you choose to work with in this class.   If you have documents that would be helpful for others to view, you can attach them to the page with the link at the bottom.   Explain why you chose this particular activity, and give some background on the sort of assessments you have done. </p>
<p><strong>4.  Standard.</strong> Locate a relevant set of educational standards and identify a standard that is relevant to this lesson.  You may have actually started with the standard if you were building a new lesson.  That is fine.  We will return to your standards later in the course.  If you are a K-12 teacher this should be pretty straightforward.  If not you will have to be creative.  But there are standards out there for almost everything and you should be familiar with them if there are.  You may have to use Google and dig around.  This does not have  to be the perfect one.  If you are a K-12 Teacher you should almost certainly use the new Common Core or the Next Generation Science standards.  Given the tumult unfolding right now, you should probably use both an existing state standard AND a common core standard. </p>
<p>After you locate a standard, (a) make header, (b) paste the test of the standard, and (c) give some context and explanation for the standard,  in terms of scope, grain size and whatever else seems relevant that you can readily locate.  Finally (d) paste a link to the standard by using Insert (upper right), Link, clicking Web Address, and inserting the link.</p>
<p><strong>5.   Read and Apply Chapter 1.  </strong>Read Chapter 1 of Popham (2014).  If you do not have the text yet it is attached below,  Read the rest of this activity first to give you a functional context for making sense of the ideas in the chapter.  You are searching for the ideas in the that chapter that seem more relevant and less relevant to your selected lesson and standard.   Insert an appropriate heading and subheadings that responds to each of these.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Yesteryear's reasons for assessing:  </strong>The first part describes four traditional reasons why yesteryear's teachers should know about assessing learning: diagnosing students's strengths and weakness, monitoring student progress, assigning grades, and determining one's own instructional effectiveness.  Describe which two reason are most relevant to YOUR lesson context, and standard and explain why.  Then state which one of the three is least relevant and why.</p>
  <p><strong>Today's reasons for assessing:</strong> The second part describes three current reasons why today's teacher should know about assessing learning: Influencing public perceptions, helping evaluate teachers, and clarifying teachers instructional intentions.  State which One reason is most relevant to your lesson, context, and standard and explain why.  Then state which one of the three is least relevant and why.</p>
  <p><strong>What teachers need to know: </strong>The third part descries three things teachers need to know about assessment: creating classroom assessment devices, interpreting standardized test results, and illuminating instruction.   State which One reason is most relevant to your lesson, context, and standard and explain why.  Then state which one of the three is least relevant and why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insert at least one question as a comment that came up for you during this activity as a comment at the bottom of the wiki.  This should be an open-ended question that will get discussion going around your wikifolio.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Discussion (before and after deadline).  </strong>After drafts are up, go in and look at each others's wikifolios and leave comment or suggestions at the bottom.  Be sure to check back and answer any questions or responses.  Your goal here is to created extended threaded discussions about the big ideas of the chapter as they relate to you.  Try to reference the text and each others activities and comments.  The instructor will try to push this conversation along without leading it.  The instructor will also provide specific comments to students that should be generally interesting to everyone.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, the instructor (and possibly the students) will wish to provide private feedback for various reasons via email.  This should only be used when there is a good reason for the communication to be private (such as suggesting that something might be inappropriate or offensive).</p>
<p><strong>7.  Reflections (within one week of the original deadline).</strong> In order to receive credit for each wikifolio, you must post three brief reflections at the bottom of the wikifolio.  You must have a coherent reflection that demonstrate understanding of the concepts and how they related to your lesson context.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Consequences.  </strong>What are the actual or potential consequences of completing this lesson for your practice?  Can you think of anything you might do differently now?  Emphasize things that you learned about assessment and about your lesson.</p>
  <p><strong>Critiques.  </strong>Now that you have a better understanding of these ideas about assessment, how good was your lesson, setting, and role for learning these things?  Did one of your classmates have a better context for learning some of these concepts?  Why?  Note that you are NOT being asked to critique or improve your lesson or your assessments. You are being asked to consider whether your lesson was the ideal context for applying and learning the big ideas in the chapter.</p>
  <p><strong>Collaboration.  </strong>Whose comments and examples were particularly helpful for you completing this assignment?  Be specific and name people and what they contributed that was helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are advised to begin drafting the reflections while you are working on the wikifolio, and then completing them before starting the next assignment.  They should serve a review and help you better connect the ideas of the chapter to your practice.</p>
