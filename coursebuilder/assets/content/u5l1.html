CONTEXT. </span><span class="c6">Summarize your assessment practice (the suite of assessments you have developed) and your institutional role as they relate to reliability and bias.

TYPES OF RELIABILITY. </span><span class="c6">For each of your examples of the assessments listed below, state which type of reliability evidence seems most relevant.  Then state what you might do to increase the reliability of YOUR assessments.  This must be specific.  Look long and hard at each of your assessments in light of the ideas in the chapter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c6">A.  Selected-Response Items</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c6">B.  Constructed-Response Items</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c6">C.  Essay Item</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c6">D.  Performance or Portfolio</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">3.

ABSENCE-OF-BIAS. </span><span class="c6">For each of the assessment formats listed below, write a paragraph that discusses (a) which type of bias (offensiveness versus unfair penalization) seems like the biggest risk and (b) which approach to reducing bias (panel judgement, per item judgement, overall judgement, or empirical) seems most appropriate.  Then state what you could to do decrease bias.  Popham discusses bias in </span><span class="c16"><a class="c10" href="http://ati.pearson.com/downloads/chapters/Popham_Bias_BK04.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><html><head></head><body>this article</body></html></a></span><span class="c6">.
