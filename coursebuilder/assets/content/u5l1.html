If you still can&#39;t come up with anything to say after reading your classmates entries, then you are free to indicate that in your entries. These are </span><span class="c9 c8">hard </span><span class="c8">questions, and some of you will struggle more than others. &nbsp;But you will return to these issues throughout the semester. </span></p><p class="c3 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>For further information on bias, it might be helpful to watch this </span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjID39cqmzw">video from the author</a></span><span>&nbsp;of our textbook, Popham.</span></p><p class="c3 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Institutional Role and Lesson</span></p><p class="c3 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Summarize your assessment practice (the suite of assessments you have developed) and your institutional role as they relate to reliability and bias.
