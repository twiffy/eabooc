If you still can&#39;t come up with anything to say after reading your classmates entries, then you are free to indicate that in your entries. These are </span><span class="c10 c5">hard </span><span class="c5">questions, and some of you will struggle more than others. &nbsp;But you will return to these issues throughout the semester. </span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>For further information on bias, it might be helpful to watch this </span><span class="c7"><a class="c12" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjID39cqmzw">video from the author</a></span><span>&nbsp;of our textbook, Popham.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>(Based on Popham Chapter 5).</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c8">Context</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">1. CONTEXT. </span><span class="c5">Summarize your assessment practice (the suite of assessments you have developed) and your institutional role as they relate to reliability and bias. Highlight the aspects of your lesson and role that are particularly relevant to these issues. &nbsp;You may need to revise these after you have completed the rest of the assignment.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c8">Concepts</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">2. TYPES OF RELIABILITY. </span><span class="c5">For each of your examples of the assessments listed below, state which type of reliability evidence seems most relevant. &nbsp;Then state what you might do to increase the reliability of YOUR assessments. &nbsp;This must be specific. &nbsp;Look long and hard at each of your assessments in light of the ideas in the chapter.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A. &nbsp;Selected-Response Items</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">B. &nbsp;Constructed-Response Items</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">C. &nbsp;Essay Item</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">D. &nbsp;Performance or Portfolio</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">3.

ABSENCE-OF-BIAS. </span><span class="c5">For each of the assessment formats listed below, write a paragraph that discusses (a) which type of bias (offensiveness versus unfair penalization) seems like the biggest risk and (b) which approach to reducing bias (panel judgement, per item judgement, overall judgement, or empirical) seems most appropriate. &nbsp;Then state what you could to do decrease bias. &nbsp;Popham discusses bias in </span><span class="c7"><a class="c12" href="http://ati.pearson.com/downloads/chapters/Popham_Bias_BK04.pdf">this article</a></span><span class="c5">. You must be specific here and if you can&#39;t think of a way to decrease bias, you need to say so.</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">A. &nbsp;SELECTED-RESPONSE ITEMS</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">B. &nbsp;CONSTRUCTED-RESPONSE ITEMS</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">C. &nbsp;ESSAY ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">D. &nbsp;PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">E. &nbsp;PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">5.
