<p><font face="arial, sans-serif">In this assignment, you will learn some general "commandments" for writing test items and then learn guidelines for specific selected response formats.  Remember, you are not necessarily making assessments that will be used; you are using the context of your lesson to learn these commandments and guidelines.  You will do so in part by figuring out which commandments, selected-response formats, and guidelines are most relevant to you and to your lesson.  Some notes and suggestions:</font></p><ul><li><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;line-height:1.5;font-size:10pt">Before completing this assignment
