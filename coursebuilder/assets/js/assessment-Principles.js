As students conclude their middle-school educations, they must complete (according to district policy) a basic skills test in reading, mathematics, and language arts. Because the scores for all of the school\u2019s students are available to her, Ms. Graves computes correlation coefficients for her students\u2019 scores on her own social studies test versus each of the three district required tests. She finds only moderate correlations between her 40-item social studies test and the other three tests. Thus, she argues that her test is, sensibly, measuring something other than reading, mathematics, and language arts.",
