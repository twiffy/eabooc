  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c9"><span>In this assignment, you will learn about a
      number of evaluation options, including absolute grading,
      relative grading, aptitude-based grading, and standards-based
      grading. You will walk through the steps of conducting
      Goal-Attainment Grading for your curricular aim.</span></p>


    <p class="c9"><span>This week’s lesson is based on Popham Chapter
      16: Assessment-Based Grading, which appears only in the sixth
      edition. Parts of this new chapter appear at the end of Chapter
      15 of earlier versions of the textbook. Do not worry, though. You
      will be directed to external sources as your primary resources.
      Popham’s chapter can serve as a secondary resource this
      week.</span></p>

  <h3>
    Evaluation Options
  </h3>

  <div>

    <p class="c9"><span>There are a number of options for evaluating
      student performance. Summarize each of the five evaluative
      options according to what they mean for you in your role and
      context. Popham discusses these in most versions of the textbook
      (look in the index to find them). You may also search the web for
      definitions. For instance,</span> <span class="c6"><a class="c11"
        target="_blank" href=
        "http://depts.washington.edu/grading/practices/prosandcons.html">this
        webpage</a></span><span>&nbsp;might be useful for comparing
      absolute to relative grading. Goal-attainment grading (scaling)

  <h3>
    Goal-Attainment Grading
    Scenario
  </h3>

  <div>

    <p class="c9"><span>Begin by carefully reading</span>
    <span class="c6"><a class="c11" target="_blank" href=
        "http://sspw.dpi.wi.gov/files/sspw/pdf/mhgoalscaling.pdf">this
        article</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>by Roach and Elliot
      (2006)</span> <span>on Goal Attainment Scaling. While this
      article was written for one particular population of students,
      the explanation of goal-attainment grading is very clear and
      applicable in most settings. This article is a good example of
      how every educator can benefit from the strategies that have
      proven effective for working with students who are struggling to
      keep up with their classmates. &nbsp;Your scenario should work in
      all of the grade-giving specifics listed in the first optional
      element below.</span></p>


    <p class="c9"><span>Then, describe how you would
      carry out goal-attainment grading for your curricular aim by
      doing each of the following:</span></p>


    <p class="c9 c13"><span class="c5">A. Create a
      Scenario</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span>Write a 1-2 paragraph scenario about a
      student in your class that would benefit from goal-attainment
      grading (refer to Roach and Elliot’s article, page 11, for a
      sample). Be sure the scenario focuses on the student’s (lack of)
      progress toward your curricular aim.</span></p>


    <p class="c9 c13"><span class="c5">B. Identify Goal-Attainment
      Evidence</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span>Describe what you will use as goal-attainment
      evidence with this student (Roach and Elliot calls this “target
      behavior”). That is, you should describe the evidence you will
      collect to show that the student is making progress toward the
      curricular aim.</span></p>


    <p class="c7"><span class="c5">C. Create a Goal-Attainment
      Scale</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span>Develop a scale, much like Roach and Elliot’s
      scale (page 10), to show how you might measure the student’s
      progress toward the goal. Feel free to use other scales that you
      might have used or learned about in the past.</span></p>


    <p class="c7"><span class="c5">D. Weight Goal-Attainment
      Evidence</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span>Describe how much weight the goal-attainment
      evidence will have in relation to other
      assignments/assessments/etc. Be prepared to explain why this
      particular goal-attainment evidence is weighted more or less than
      other assignments/assessments/etc in the course. Also, explain
      how you arrive at the final grade for the course, showing your
      peers how this one piece of goal-attainment evidence described
      above fits into the entire course.</span></p>
