  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c5"><span>In this assignment, you will learn about
      appropriate and inappropriate test preparation practices by
      drafting scenarios and discussing them with your classmates to
      see whether or not they are appropriate.</span></p>


    <p class="c5"><span>To help appreciate how these guidelines apply
      to different testing formats, you are asked to create scenarios
      for different high-stakes assessments your students will face.
      This is the point in the course where everybody should be
      confidently projecting their professional identity and
      recognizing and anticipating those of their classmates.
      &nbsp;What you teach, where you teach, and how students are
      assessed makes a very big difference in what is appropriate.
      Likewise, there is often a wide divergence between what
      administrators and teachers think is appropriate. There should be
      some serious discussion here about these issues.</span></p>


    <p class="c5"><span>This assignment is associated with Popham
      Chapter 14 (7th edition). &nbsp;There are chapters in this topic
      in the earlier versions and there is quite a bit of information
      on this topic available on the web.</span></p>

<div class="wiki-question">
  <h3>Reiterate Your Context (by July 13)
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c5"><span>Provide a short summary of your lesson and
      context from the first assignment for the benefit of the other
      participants (so they don’t have to look back). &nbsp;You should
      also add any new insights about the lesson that have emerged as
      you have thought about it more in the previous
      assignment(s).</span></p>


    <p class="c5"><span>In particular, think about your lesson and
      context relative to test preparation. What is appropriate and
      inappropriate may depend on your role and some subjects and tests
      are more readily compromised. &nbsp;Those of you in non-school
      settings have a choice of getting creative and finding something
      like a workplace test, or just using one of the K-12
      tests.</span></p>

<h2>Consider The Concepts (All required by July 13)</h2>

<div class="wiki-question">
  <h3>General Test Preparation
    Guidelines
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c5"><span>There are two guidelines that can be used to
      judge whether an assessment is “appropriate” or “inappropriate,”
      says Popham. These two guidelines are:</span></p>


    <ul class="c7 lst-kix_9o0cbfos8xg1-0 start">
      <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Professional Ethics
        --</span><span>&nbsp;“No test-preparation should violate the
        ethical norms of the education profession” (Popham, p.
        358).</span></li>

      <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Educational Defensibility
        --</span> <span>“No test-preparation practice should increase
        students’ test scores without simultaneously increasing
        students’ mastery of the curricular aim tested” (Popham, p.
        359).</span></li>
    </ul>


    <p class="c5"><span>In a number of paragraphs, explain and
      discuss t</span><span>he two evaluative guidelines in your own
      words. Try to elaborate on the consequences of these guidelines
      for practice, consider the challenges educators might encounter
      in following these guidelines, and summarize the role that test
      form and test item format play in distinguishing between
      appropriate and inappropriate test preparation.</span></p>


    <p class="c5"><span>Explicitly ponder how these guidelines take
      on different meanings for (a) different assessment formats, (b)
      different domains, and (c) different roles.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="wiki-user-content">{{ fields.guidelines }}</div>
{{ inline_save() }}




<div class="wiki-question">
  <h3>Selected-Response
    Scenario
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c5"><span>Write a testing scenario, based on your own
      teaching and testing context, where the appropriateness of the
      situation is called into question. The scenario should push your
      classmates to apply the two guidelines relative to preparing your
      students for the highest-stakes selected-response test you
      discuss. Your scenario should include a reference to item format
      (i.e., require a judgment as to whether the format
      is </span><span class=
      "c3">same </span><span>or </span><span class="c3">varied</span><span>). Try to
      draft a tricky scenario that prompts discussion and debate and
      reveals how different stakeholders have different interpretations
      of what is “ethical” and “educational.” &nbsp;You want to
      specifically address how testing practices might be called into
      question when students are asked to recall information
      (selected-response). The point here is to consider the
      appropriateness of test-preparation practices for
      selected-response formats.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="wiki-user-content">{{ fields.selected_scenario }}</div>
{{ inline_save() }}




<div class="wiki-question">
  <h3>Constructed-Response
    Scenario
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c5"><span>Write another scenario that calls the test
      preparation practices into question. Again, try to draft a tricky
      scenario that helps reveal the range of interpretations of
      “ethical” and “educational” and how this is complicated by
      broader item formats.</span> <span>The point here is to consider
      how test preparation is impacted when a high-stakes examination
      is based on recalling information (selected-response) vs.
      constructing a solution (constructed-response).</span></p>

<div class="wiki-question">
  <h3>Apply Educationally Defensible
    Test Preparation Practices
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c5"><span>Popham describes five Test-Preparation
      Practices that are very commonly used among teachers. He finds
      that only two of the five satisfy both Professional Ethics and
      Educational Defensibility (table 14.1, page 364):.</span></p>


    <ul class="c7 lst-kix_wxhh4v292ksp-0 start">
      <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Varied format
        preparation</span> <span>involves preparing students with
        classroom assessments that represent content in varied ways,
        which can include the way it is represented on the
        test.</span></li>

      <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Generalized test taking
        preparation</span> <span>involves special instructions for
        particular types of test formats.</span></li>
    </ul>


    <p class="c5"><span>Rearrange the boxes to indicate which form of
      preparation is most appropriate for whatever high-stakes tests
      your students face. &nbsp;Even if you accept the order that they
      are, move them up and down so the assignment knows you did the
      activity. Then explain why the first is more relevant than the
      second. &nbsp;You can use any criteria that are important to you,
      but your answers should show understanding of the difference
      between increased scores and increased learning.</span></p>

<div class="wiki-question">
  <h3>Consider Inappropriateness of
    Common Test Preparation Practices
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p class="c5"><span>Popham describes three common test
      preparation practices that are not educationally
      defensible:</span></p>


    <ul class="c7 lst-kix_k2qpkky2j1oi-0 start">
      <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Previous-form
        preparation</span> <span>provides special instruction and
        practice using previous forms of the actual test</span></li>

      <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Current-form preparation</span>
      <span>provides special instruction and practice using the test
        currently being used</span></li>

      <li class="c0"><span class="c4">Same format preparation</span>
      <span>uses practice items that are identical in format to the
        items on the targeted test, even though the content of the
        items may be different.</span></li>
    </ul>


    <p class="c5"><span>Rearrange to boxes to indicate which form of
      preparation is</span> <span class="c3">most
      inappropriate</span><span>&nbsp;in terms of inflating scores,
      undermining learning, etc. &nbsp;In other words the first form or
      preparation is the one that is most damaging to students, while
      the last one is least damaging. &nbsp;(rearrange the boxes even
      if you accept the order they start in). &nbsp;Then provide a
      justification for the ranking that makes it clear why the first
      one is most inappropriate and the last one is least
      inappropriate. &nbsp;Take into account the overall consequences
      of the practice and consider discussion how common these
      practices are and how hard it is to avoid them.</span></p>
